<!--     
MVC is defined as:
    - Model: is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller & independent of the user interface.  (manages the data, logic and rules of the application)

    - View: Presentation of the model in a particular format (flexibility in choice)

    - Controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects ( for the model or view.)
